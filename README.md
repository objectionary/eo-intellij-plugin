## How to Contribute

Fork repository, make changes, send us a [pull request](https://www.yegor256.com/2014/04/15/github-guidelines.html).
We will review your changes and apply them to the `master` branch shortly,
provided they don't violate our quality standards. To avoid frustration,
before sending us your pull request please run full gradle build:

```bash
$ gradle build
```
For checking code quality we use [Qulice](https://www.qulice.com/index.html)

```bash
$ gradle qulice
```

You will need [Gradle](https://gradle.org/guides/), [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) and Java 14+ installed.



## Structure

Project has two parts: manually written and auto-generated.

In `src/main` you may find source code. Classes listed there are not auto-generated. They describe EO language and `.eo` extension.

The second part is auto-generated classes. They should be generated from `.g4` file and moved into
`src/java/org/eolang/jetbrains/parser`. The grammar will be downloaded automatically
during `build` gradle task. Needed class will be generated at the same time.

Resources (icons and `plugin.xml`) are located in `src/resources`.

We use [Rultor](https://github.com/yegor256/rultor) for publishing (see `.rultor.yml`).

## How it Works

Plugin is implemented in Java and ANTLR4 grammar.

[ANTLR4 adapter](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4-intellij-adaptor) is used for generating `EOLexer` and `EOParser` classes.

## Compiling EO sources using plugin

In order to compile eo sources withing the project it must be maven project.
Its `pom` file should contain `eo-maven-plugin` configuration as follows:
```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.eolang</groupId>
        <artifactId>eo-maven-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>0.27.0</version>
        <configuration>
          <foreign>${project.basedir}/target/eo/foreign.csv</foreign>
          <foreignFormat>csv</foreignFormat>
          <hash>master</hash>
          <failOnWarning>true</failOnWarning>
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
```
Having this set up compilation can be triggered by `Build -> EO compile` menu action.
